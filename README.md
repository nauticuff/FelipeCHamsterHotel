CODE: Coding a responsive website from an AdobeXD prototype.
PEER REVIEW: Great great work! Love the mobile and tablet side, also like the process of scaling up from a mobile site rather than scaling down from a desktop site. Great work and creativity for the carousels in mobile! Great project overall!
